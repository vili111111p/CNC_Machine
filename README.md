# CNC Machine
So its basicly a cnc machine, that im making. I beginn it two years ago and i hope soon i will finish it.
It has a couple of features, like its platform is a ~2cm thick steel plate from a robot arm, so its really sturdy. It has two side, one is cnc and one is laser cutting machine.

The structure is 80x80 item 80x80 item extrusions on an old robot arm table which i got from a company who didnt need it.

The CNC's volume is around 1.1m x 0.9m x 0.3m. The laser cutters is 0.5m x 0.9m.

The motors are has 3 stepper motors which i have to expand with one for sure, maybe more. Two for x axis and one for the y. I will have to get one for the z also. The steppers are driving ball screws, but they are not assembled in right now so they wont have any problems till then.

## 3D model
